The stringstream class in C++ allows a string object to be treated as a stream. It is used to operate on strings. By treating the strings as streams we can perform extraction and insertion operation from/to string just like cin and cout streams.

These types of operations are mostly useful to convert string to numerical data types and vice versa. The stringstream class also proves to be helpful in different types of parsing.
