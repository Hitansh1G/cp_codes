Vectors are known as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.
Vector of Vectors is a two-dimensional vector with a variable number of rows where each row is vector. Each index of vector stores a vector which can be traversed and accessed using iterators. It is similar to an Array of Vectors but with dynamic properties.

Syntax:



vector<vector<data_type>> vec;
