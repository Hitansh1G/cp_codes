sort(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To sort the given vector.

reverse(first_iterator, last_iterator) – To reverse a vector.

*max_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the maximum element of a vector.

*min_element (first_iterator, last_iterator) – To find the minimum element of a vector.

accumulate(first_iterator, last_iterator, initial value of sum) – Does the summation of vector elements

count(first_iterator, last_iterator,x) – To count the occurrences of x in vector.

find(first_iterator, last_iterator, x) – Returns an iterator to the first occurence of x in vector and points to last address of vector ((name_of_vector).end()) if element is not present in vector.

distance(first_iterator,desired_position) – It returns the distance of desired position from the first iterator.This function               is very useful while finding the index.

next_permutation(first_iterator, last_iterator) – This modified the vector to its next permutation.

prev_permutation(first_iterator, last_iterator) – This modified the vector to its previous permutation.
